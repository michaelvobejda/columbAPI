# ColumbAPI

### Who are you?!
My name is Michael Vobejda! I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Stanford and a member of the wonderful community known as Columbae.

### What is this?!
This is an Ionic app I'm building for Columbae as a personal project. I think it will be very useful to my fellow Beans. Plus, I get to learn mobile app development with a brand new technology!

### What are you working on now?!
Right now I'm working on getting push notifications working for DAHAs.

### What features do you want to finish before you release a Minimum Viable Product?!
Good question!
- Push Notifications
  - upon creation of a DAHA, to everyone
  - upon acceptance of a DAHA, to the DAHA's creator
  - upon creation of a Job Switch, to everyone
- Food Page
  - add custom allergy input on startup and display on Late Plate list

### What features do you want to implement at some point in the future?!
- Home Page
  - news feed type thing, with static "articles"
- Settings Page
  - change name
  - upload/modify profile picture
  - update dietary restrictions
- About Page
  - not sure, information about the house/me?

### And after that?!
I need to get an Apple developer account, request the app to be added to the App store, and then announce the project to the house! 


# Stop ranting. How do I run this on my machine?
- Install node.js
- `git clone https://github.com/michaelvobejda/columbAPI.git`
- `npm install`
- `ionic serve -c`
- Open in DevApp
- ???
- Profit
